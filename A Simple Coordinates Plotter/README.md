## A Simple Coordinates Plotter - Still a work in progress.........

This Python application reads a .csv file containing latitude and longitude points, saves the points to a list and displays those points on a map generated from your web browser.

A user can plot points that are inputted into the provided coordinates.csv file or input the full path to a file at a different location on the user's computer.


If a user selects option 1, then the coordinates inputted into the coordinates.csv file will display on the web based map.





If a user select option 2, then the user will be prompted to input the file path to a .csv file on the user's computers to have those coordinates displayed on a web based map.






This application was tested using Python 3. 
Required Python libraries:

csv
web browser
folium

This is a very simple implementation. I do plan to add more functionality and features to this application.
